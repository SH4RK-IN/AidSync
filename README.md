## Inspiration
My inspiration to build this project was to help people around me. As I live in a hilly area, there are a lot of cases here in which a patient died in an ambulance due to a lack of knowledge of the disease. Hence, to save the lives of people, I made this project, **AidSync**.

## What it does
It predicts the disease on the basis of the symptoms given.

## How I built it
I built it using Flask and RandomForestClassifier.
